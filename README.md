# Uber-Clone-React-Native
An Uber-Clone iOS Application built with React Native

## Project Setup
This React Native project was bootstrapped with [Expo CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Running the Project
#### Step 1: Buy a two-thousand dollar MacBook
This application is built to run on *iOS*. You will need to have `Xcode` installed on your Apple Computer.
#### Step 2: Install the Expo CLI
You need Node.js installed on your machine. Then you can use npm or yarn to install Expo CLI
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
#### Step 3: Configure Environment Vars
You will need a *Google API Key* that has access to the `Directions`, `Places`, and `Distance Matrix` APIs. 

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, and then add in the following: 
```
GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY=<Your-Google-API-Key>
```
#### Step 4: Run Project
Simply `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install` and then `npm start`
Lastly, you can press `i` to launch the application on the iPhone Simulator
